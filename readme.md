1. This will only work properly on computers.
2. IOS devices will not download the file. (MAC OS was not tested)
3. An internet connection is required for the Photos and update script.
3. Suggested Chrome web browser version: v6.1 and above
4. Suggested Internet Explorer (IE) version: v11
* Note: I do not suggest using Internet Explorer because version 11 was reported to not support ES6 which is what the animation system relies on.
