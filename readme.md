#### This is a project to make a logo turned into a web page development. This was made for fun and may be discontinued.

1. This will only work on computers.
2. Suggested Chrome web browser version: v6.1 and above
3. Suggested Internet Explorer (IE) version: v11
* Note: I do not suggest using Internet Explorer because version 11 was reported to not support ES6 which is what the animation system relies on.
