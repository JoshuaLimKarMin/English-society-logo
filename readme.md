#### This is a project to make a logo turned into a web page development. This was made for fun and may be discontinued.

      1. This will only work on computers.
      2. Suggested Chrome web browser version: v6.1 and above
      3. Suggested Internet Explorer (IE) version: v11
      Note: I do not suggest using Internet Explorer because Internet Explorer is old and probably does not support ES6 which is what the animation system built with.
